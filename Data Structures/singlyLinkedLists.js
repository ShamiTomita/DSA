//singley linked list and how is it different from an array
//stores any sort of data, ordered
//in an array, each item is indexed
//a singley linked list has no indices, only a relationship between links
//each element is a node and references the next one (or null)
//keep track of the head, the tail and the length
//insertion is easier since we dont have to worry about reindexing items
