//GRAPHS
//graph data structures consists of a finite (possibly mutable)
//set of vertices or nodes or points,
//together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected
//graph or a set of oredered pairs for a directed graph

//graph is a collection of nodes and their connections
//nodes are treated equally
//USES:
//social networking, google maps, pathfinding, visual hierarchy, recommendations
//for maps-> nodes are locations and connections are "paths"

//vertex is a Node
//Edge is a connection between vertices
//Undirected graph - no polarity no direction between the edges of vertices
//directed graph - yes polarity (you get deadends)
//weighted - each edge has no value assoicated
//unweighted - assign a value to the edge
//google maps would be a directed weighted graph
